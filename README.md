# SaveTheBall
In this Game i have programmed an arcade style sumo Battle,
with the objective of knocking waves of increasingly numerous enemies off of a floating island.
The player will have to Use Powerups in a desperate effort to withstand their relentless onslaught.


A Gameplay Mechanic is a rule of system in your game that ideally makes it more intresting to play,
I have used a powerup Mechanic a temporary state that will give the player an advantage,
These are not only super fun for the player to use but can completely change the way a game is played

Now the user needs to decide should i go for the Powerup Now?
Maybe i should save the Powerup? What should i do When i get the Powerup?

All this New Questions and Strategies will suddenly emerge and make game way more interesting.


## The Oher Mechanic will introduce
if you defeat all the enemies a new wave will appear with one more enemy than the previous Wave,
increasing the difficulty over time. 
This will also completely change the way the game can be played because instead of being static experience that the player can quickly master,
and become bored of it has limitless potential to challenge even the most expert Players.


## These Two Gameplay Mechanics "Powerups" and "Increasing Difficulty" 
go hand and hand because as the game increases in the difficulty there are new Powerups to match it 
This combination basically removes all the limitations.
